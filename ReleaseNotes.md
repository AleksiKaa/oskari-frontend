Environment specific localized values (URLs) have been move to bundle configuration. If something is broken, check the new configurations to fix it.

## 1.13

### mapmodule plugin

A new MapSizeChangedEvent is sent when map size is changed (event is sent on mapmodule.updateSize() function call which should always be called if the map size is changed programmatically)

### admin-layerselector

Adding base and group layers and sublayers to them is now possible. Also, adding sublayers individually from GetCapabilities query now works.

### statsgrid bundle

### usagetracker bundle

Configurable event-based usage tracker. New bundle based on statehandler.

### printout bundle

A new event `Printout.PrintableContentEvent` which can be used to send additional data to the printout bundle. Event accepts contentId (to identify each GeoJSON chunk), layer (Oskari layer), tile data (an array of {bbox: [l,b,r,t], url: 'image url'} objects) and GeoJSON as arguments.

Legend plot for statslayer in printout

### mapmodule-plugin/mapfull/publisher bundles

Mapmodule now has a method to notify openlayers and internal datamodels that map size has changed: updateSize(). Mapfull and publisher changed to use it instead of handling it on their own. This ensures the map domain in sandbox is up-to-date and functionalities depending on it (like GFI) work correctly.

MapClickEvent now rounds clicked pixel coordinates so even if browser zoom is used, it returns integer values for pixels.

### mapmodule plugins zoombar, panbuttons and bundles coordinatedisplay and feature

Reverted plugins placement change from 1.10 so these are no longer placed inside openlayers container div with fixed position

### mapmodule plugin/wmslayerplugin

If min and max scale are not defined, scales are not specified for layer. There is a bug on scale handling when resolution is "low enough". This can be used as a workaround for the time being.

### statsgrid bundle

Municipalities are now grouped and there are statistical variables added to the header row. CSV download button created in the frontend.

### mapstats bundle

LayerPlugin now disables hover/highlight functionality if a StatsLayer is not added/visible on the map

### statistics/publishedgrid bundle
This is created for published maps so that it shows also grid if there is one.

### statistics/statsgrid bundle
Indicators which do not have data for all municipalities now show the missing values as blanks in the grid and on the map. This doesn't affect sorting, the blank values are always in the bottom when sorted.

### mapmodule plugins zoombar, panbuttons and bundles coordinatedisplay and feature

Plugins are now placed inside openlayers container div so that infobox is placed above them

## 1.9

### printout bundle

geojson extension added for background print service 

### toolbar bundle

Added a way to disable a button by default from configuration.

### promote bundle

Layers can now have tools linked to them. OpenLayer options and params can be passed as arguments.

### mapstats bundle

StatsLayerPlugin now registers layer model/builder to map-layer-service on init.

StatsLayerPlugin registers tool links for STATS layer icon callbacks and Statistics mode.

ManageClassificationPlugin  classifies stats data and generates legend (geostats library is in use)

WMTS specific layer model/builder registration has been removed from mapfull (now registered in mapwmts/plugin/WmtsLayerPlugin.init())

Mapfull now starts map and plugins before starting to parse layers JSON so plugins can register layermodels and builders.

### mapmodule-plugin bundle/ControlsPlugin

Map controls are now configurable (zoombox and measure controls) - by setting the control values as false the control is not added. 

### oskariui bundle

Added Bootstrap grid CSS to Oskari

### mapmodule-plugin bundle/WmsLayerPlugin

WmsLayerPlugin passes AbstractLayer options and params to OpenLayers.Layer.WMS
For example params allows format to be changed to "image/jpg" and options allows singleTile: true to be added

## 1.7

### core/sandbox

Added multimap support. Reference to {Oskari.mapframework.sandbox.Sandbox} should now be fetched through Oskari.getSandbox() method. 

Oskari.$('sandbox') still works but is deprecated.

Bundle now provides a new plugin Oskari.mapframework.bundle.featuredata.plugin.MapSelectionPlugin for drawing selections on map

new method getSelectionPlugin() is added to instance.js which returns Oskari.mapframework.bundle.featuredata.plugin.MapSelectionPlugin

getBBox() is replaced with getGeometry() in WfsGridUpdateParams.js

### mapfull/mapmodule bundle

Configurable SrsName projection to be used, default srsName is "EPSG:3067"

        // rewrite creation of drawPlugin in the start-function
        // register plugin for map (drawing for my places) 
        var drawPlugin = Oskari.clazz.create('Oskari.mapframework.bundle.myplaces2.plugin.DrawPlugin', { graphicFill : newStyle });
```

Multiple points, lines and polygons are now supported objects in My places. After each drawn feature a new MyPlaces.AddedFeatureEvent event is sent.
After the drawing is finished by the user, the existing MyPlaces.FinishedDrawingEvent is sent. Enabled with config:

```javascript
        var drawPlugin = Oskari.clazz.create('Oskari.mapframework.bundle.myplaces2.plugin.DrawPlugin', { multipart : true });
```

My places draw plugin can now be configured to send namespaced events. Plugin name is also prefixed with namespace, map can have multiple drawplugins at the same time.
Enabled with config:

```javascript
        var drawPlugin = Oskari.clazz.create('Oskari.mapframework.bundle.myplaces2.plugin.DrawPlugin', { id : '<namespace>' });

        ->

    eventHandlers : {
        '<namespace>.AddedFeatureEvent' : function(event) {}
```

### framework.domain

Created AbstractLayer.js that is inherited by all layer implementations. The abstract function implementations will unify layer functionality. The WmtsLayer will also correctly use legends if defined and type 'wmtslayer' will return false when called isLayerOfType. Use 'wmts' instead.
