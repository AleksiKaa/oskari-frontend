### Welcome to Bundle Documentation of 

#Oskari Map Application Framework

## What is this documentation about?

Bundles are used as uniform containers to ship and share new functionality to the application setups. Additions to existing functionality are implemented as Plugins shipped within the bundles. 

Starting from the new Oskari versioning scheme 1.0+ provides applications with loose coupling and inter-bundle messaging with Requests and Events, con!guration, application state and localization support. Loose coupling enables reusing bundles in diï¬€erent application setups.

Map functionality is implemented with **OpenLayers**. The user interface components are based on **jQuery**, see **JavaScript libraries** for a more complete list of libraries used and to be used.

## The preferred way of contributing to Oskari in a nutshell:

1. Fork nls-oskari/oskari on GitHub 
2. Develop your code in a feature branch 
3. Notify us when the code is ready for QA and integration testing (GitHub pull request, email, anything really)

See **SourceCodeManagementProcess** for details.
